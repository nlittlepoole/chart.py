# Charts.py

Chart py is a python charting library based on the open source Chart.js


Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site] [1]:

> Charts.py exists to make inserting charts into python projects as simple as possible.
> The syntax for this wrapper is constructed to be as simple to use as possible. 


This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
